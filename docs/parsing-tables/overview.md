The ability to automatically identify and extract tables from PDF documents is a highly sought-after feature.

This is an active area of research and we aim to expose the best available tools to the community. This is a blend of newer deep learning approaches and traditional bounding box-based methods. We aim to be parsing algorithm agnostic and allow users to choose the method that best suits their needs.

Currently, we support three methods for extracting tables from PDFs.

- If you have experience with quantizing models or optimizing them for inference, we would love to hear from you! Unitable achieves **state-of-the-art performance** on table extraction, but it is computationally expensive.  We are looking to optimize the model for inference and reduce the size of the model.
